    <div class="welcome-paragraphs card">
        <p>This portal is a support center for the imaginary <strong>BUZZ</strong> application</p>
        <p>Here you can log-in to view and submit tickets relating to <strong>BUZZ</strong>.</p> 
        <p>Tickets can either be for Bug fixes or Feature requests. Both of which can be voted 
            on to increase their ranking.</p>
        <p>To vote on a Bug is free, but to vote on a feature you must pay a fee of <strong>â‚¬5</strong>.
             We promise to spend at least <strong>50%</strong> of our time working on the highest ranking feature request</p>
        <p>We also have a blog which is updated regularly with interesting articles related to the <strong>BUZZ</strong></p>
